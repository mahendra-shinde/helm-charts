--------|------------|-------------|------------
 1 | apps/vote-app-0.1.0 | A Sample Application (Azure Vote App) which uses Redis as Backend datastore. | [Open](./apps/vote-app-0.1.0)
 2 | apps/vote-app-0.2.0 | A Sample Application (Azure Vote App) which uses another chart as dependency (stable/redis) | [Open](./apps/vote-app-0.2.0)
